TODO

- possible option: send email ourselves
- possible option: set a reasonable job name, don't just use the commandline
- try to extract the job period/frequency fron crontab
- need to trap signals and cleanup
- check to see if we can find the various unix utilities we need and if not
  then issue a warning, and run the command directly in passthrough

IDEAS
- update a google calendar with job start and end times (gcalcli)
